        "A striking, contemporarised, printed, stole in the traditional Ajrakh printing technique that is said to be nearly 4,500 years old. Ajrakh is an ancient vegetable dyeing and resist block-printing technique done on cloth . The process of 'Ajrakh' is a long drawn process involving many stages of printing. Each layer of visible colour is printed after a gap of time so the cloth has time to to cure for the day,giving it it's unique name (aaj-rakh). Originating in Sindh, Pakistan, and presently crafted by artisans in Kutch, Ajrakh block printing uses motifs inspired by nature. Kutch Craft Collective is a collaborative platform of 5 organizations from Kutch and was formed to revive the old crafts of Kutch, while creating livelihood opportunities for the artisan families. Amongst the five organizations of KCC, VRDI (Vivekananda Rural Development Institute) was established in 1988 with the mission of skill enhancement of Kutchi artisans and develop craft enterprises. It undertakes training, production, market support, and capacity building of craft enterprises in Mandvi & Mundra. Peepul Tree is proud to join hands with KCC in presenting Kutch 's most authentic art and craft forms. Quantity:1 Piece Care Instructions: Professional Dry Clean Only. Ships within 7-15days.

        "Mata Ni Pachedi is also called the Kalamkari of Gujarat thanks to its resemblance to the art of Kalamkari from South India and the same method of painting, namely using a pen (kalam) made out of bamboo. Mata Ni Pachedi, in the local dialect literally translates to ‘behind the mother goddess’. This artform is believed to have evolved 300 years ago, when the devotees from the Devipujak or the Vaghri community in Gujarat and Rajasthan were barred from entering temples. They created their own place of worship by elaborately painting stories of local patron goddesses on large rectangular cloths. Different forms of goddesses are depicted in the most traditional colours, made of natural dyes.Bahuchar Mata or Becharaji, is depicted in this painting, seated on a rooster. She is the goddess of fertility and locals seek her blessings for fulfillment of their wishes. Several devotees, animals and mythological characters are painted in the background.Quantity : 1 Painting without frame.Care instructions : Keep away from direct sunlight, moisture, water and other liquids. To preserve this artwork, keep in frame with glass. Shipping:This painting is made to order and cannot be shipped immediately. Minimum time to create this masterpiece would be 35-45days.",

Wool weaving is an ancient tradition in Himachal Pradesh, carried forward today by the weavers who inhabit its hills and valleys. Depending on the weave, pattern and the kind of yarn being used, a single weaver can weave from one metre to five metres in a day, creating unique and distinct designs in the process. Kullu Karishma helps keep this age-old tradition alive by working with weavers from the hilly villages of Himachal Pradesh. Now you can find this fine collection of products that are woven by the talented weavers of Himachal Pradesh, on PeepulTree.

        "A striking, contemporarised, printed, stole in the traditional Ajrakh printing technique that is said to be nearly 4,500 years old. Ajrakh is an ancient vegetable dyeing and resist block-printing technique done on cloth . The process of 'Ajrakh' is a long drawn process involving many stages of printing. Each layer of visible colour is printed after a gap of time so the cloth has time to to cure for the day,giving it it's unique name (aaj-rakh). Originating in Sindh, Pakistan, and presently crafted by artisans in Kutch, Ajrakh block printing uses motifs inspired by nature. Kutch Craft Collective is a collaborative platform of 5 organizations from Kutch and was formed to revive the old crafts of Kutch, while creating livelihood opportunities for the artisan families. Amongst the five organizations of KCC, VRDI (Vivekananda Rural Development Institute) was established in 1988 with the mission of skill enhancement of Kutchi artisans and develop craft enterprises. It undertakes training, production, market support, and capacity building of craft enterprises in Mandvi & Mundra.

        "These Shola Lights are a handmade shola string of fairy lights with delicate, life-like flowers. They are a reflection of fine craftsmanship. According to folklore, Lord Shiva was on his way to marry Parvati when he requested Lord Vishwakarma, to make him a white crown for his wedding. However, the great builder Vishwakarma wasn’t able to make the crown that Shiva desired. It was then that Shiva created a man, who in turn created an exquisite crown, garland and other ornaments from the soft white core of the shola plant. The man was named “Malakar”. The Shola craftsmen who mostly belong to Bengal are still called “Malakar” which means “Makers of Garlands”. Shola is an aquatic plant which has milky white sponge-like stems. The Malakars use tools such as blades and threads and spend months meticulously transforming these stems into beautiful decorative shola pieces.",

Inspired by the very famous Dancing Girl of the 4000 year old Harappan civilization, this replica of the famous sculpture of Harappan civilization found in the site of Mohenjo-daro has been made using the same technique that was used back then. Dhokra artists across the tribal belt of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Telangana use the same lost wax technique that was used by the Bronze Age Harappans, to make their bronze figurines and statues. Our Dhokra artist, Somnath Karmakar has been inspired by the ancient past to recreate one of India's most famous pieces of Harappan civilization.

The double-sided block printed Ajrakh fabric is still made in the traditional way using natural dyes. On PeepulTree, you will find an assortment of Indian textiles from the far corners of India. These arts are iconic as they represent centuries-old traditions, and use natural material inspired by the land they come from. Shipping : 7-8 days Return Policy : No return",

        'Experience the perfect blend of style, sustainability, and comfort with these yoga pants made from 100% slubbed cotton printed with natural dyes that allow your skin to breathe.Designed in collaboration with yoga teachers in India, these pants feature drawstrings at the waist and an elasticised hem, ensuring a comfortable fit.The traditional hand block print on this fabric has been created using the Bagru method, an eco-friendly technique that uses hand-carved wooden blocks dipped in natural dyes created primarily with locally-sourced ingredients.What\'s more, the slub cotton used in these pants is intentionally left with slight "lumps" or "imperfections," created through knotting or twisting the fabric as it is woven or spun, resulting in a unique and beautiful texture.This collection uses fabrics sourced directly from artisan communities in India, making it as kind to the planet as it is to your body. Care Instructions : Hand wash separately in cold water using mild detergent. Line dry in shade. Do not bleach.

The Ikat combines the beauty of tradition and the ability to adapt to the most modern renditions. Our earliest visual reference to the Ikat comes from the murals of the Ajanta caves, which go back 1,200-1,600 years. The Ikat is a unique weave, where the threads of the warp or the weft are patiently tied and then dyed multiple times, depending on the number of colours used. It is believed that this form of weaving travelled across the world from India. Quantity: 1 piece Care instructions: Hand wash separately in cold water, using mild detergent. This product is handwoven by our artisans and may have slight irregularities.",

        "An exquisite almost bridal drape, golden intricate designs on flowing silk, here is a riveting pure Banarasi katan silk brocade saree. A study in grandeur and vibrance, and the rarest of beauty, this dazzling creation is more than attractive. The ghats and silks of Banaras have a strong connection- they both represent a confluence of roads and travelers who have passed through this city. This is reflected in the mixed influences seen on the sarees- Persian, Chinese, Southeast Asian and different parts of the Indian subcontinent. Varanasi was a well-known cotton weaving hub during the early Buddhist period. Even though the fineness of Banarasi silks has been mentioned in Buddhist texts, silks gained prominence here during the time of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar(1556-1605 CE) and it is during his time that the introduction of Persian motifs took place. With the influx of skilled brocade weavers from Gujarat and an amalgamation with all the various influences the many specialized weaves that Banaras is so renowned for came into being. This saree is brought to Peepul Tree by Mrinalini. Mrinalini is a platform to help handloom weavers across the country with the aim to preserve and protect India's treasured craft heritage. Mrinalini passionately honours the ageless knowledge of India's finest weavers while preserving traditional handloom techniques. All Mrinalini sarees are made from high quality, natural yarns. Quantity-1 saree with blouse piece. Ships within 7-15days. In order to maintain fairness to our artisans, as well as to keep our prices fair, this product is not returnable and non refundable. Care instructions-Professional Dry Clean Only. This product is handwoven by artisans on traditional looms and may have slight irregularities that are a natural outcome of the human involvement in the process. Naturally dyed fabrics and threads may bleed. Store garment separately, away from sunlight without exposure to any moisture. Air the textile every few months so that you may enjoy this drape for many years to come. The colours seen in the image may vary from the actual product due to photographic lighting source, different computer screen resolutions and displays.",
